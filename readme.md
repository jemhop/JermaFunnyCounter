# AS OF CURRENT, THIS PROJECT IS ABANDONED, AS A WEBSITE THAT DOES THE SAME THING ALREADY EXISTS.

## ~~Jerma985 Funny Guy Extra Funny Man Tracker Funny Website For His Funny Points~~

~~<img src="https://i.redd.it/b6hm1rjvsgc41.jpg" width=100% height="100" />
This is a simple website designed to keep track of the total number of +2 and -2 ratings Jerma gets across all streams. While, to my knowledge the Twitch API doesn't allow me to run this retroactively on VODS, and most VODS will have lost their chat, I can atleast start collecting an average now.~~

~~As of right now, the backend is a Node.js/Express/Socket.io server, and the frontend is just HTML, CSS (Technically SASS but same  thing), and JS.~~
